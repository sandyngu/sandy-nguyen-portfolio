                        My name is Sandy and I am a full-stack web developer & registered nurse. 
                        I am excited to make a career transition to web development; I love seeing
                        complex ideas come to fruition through problem-solving and implementation of 
                        various technical languages. I am committed to lifelong learning and am so 
                        eager to grow my technical skills and build wonderful, life-altering applications.
                        My passion for technology extends to my hobby of playing PC games in my 
                        spare time -- particularly Valorant and League of Legends. I even built my own PC this spring!

                        <br/><br/>Below is a showcase of the various projects I was able to complete. 
                        Don't hesitate to get in touch with me through LinkedIn, GitHub or e-mail!
